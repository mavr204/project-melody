### 🛠️ To-Do:

1. **Input Pipeline Improvements**

   * Build a proper thread manager.
   * Build a queue manager.
   * Add custom errors (for better debugging & control).
   * Handle template-related exceptions better (e.g., save failure, encryption error, etc.).

2. **Audio Processing**

   * Preprocess audio (remove low-frequency/background noise).
   * Add proper audio filters.

3. **Wake Word System**

   * Build a dedicated wake-word detection model.
   * Move beyond hardcoded one-shot logic.

4. **Security**

   * Encrypt the stored template. ✅
   * Lock down file access (`chmod`, etc.).✅
   * Possibly hash + verify integrity of templates.✅

5. **Template Management**

   * Implement **template improvement** (adaptive enrollment after successful wakeups).
   * clear template, new template
   * Possibly use a running average or sliding buffer.
   * Log or audit template changes.

6. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

   * Build the NLU system to handle more than just `"play music"`.
   * Smart follow-up and context awareness.
